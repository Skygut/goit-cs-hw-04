In this example, we'll demonstrate how to use a test to determine the correctness of our code. 
For instance, we can create a test to verify different parts of the program. 
Such an example can be useful for testing various scenarios. 
An example test case will help us ensure everything is working properly. 
For example, we can run the test to check if the correct output is being produced.
